<p class="title">Use Case Rating</p>
<br>
<p>George logs into Cartridge Coders and pulls up the messaging form which also allows ratings.</p>
<p>He fills out the rating for a recent purchase he made with Robert.  After filling out the form, he looks around to see if there are any other games he may want.  Not seeing any, he then logs out and shuts down his computer.</p>
